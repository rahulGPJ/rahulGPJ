Barclays Performance Review - The What & The How Sections

Box 1: The What – Achievements in relation to objectives

This year, I successfully completed the end-to-end development and production release of the Partner Bank applications — NPE and NPS.

For the NPE application, I delivered all three tranches, while for NPS, I completed two tranches, ensuring smooth delivery, testing, and production rollout.

I also completed the development and SIT phase of the SPHIBRDA application, contributing to successful milestone achievement for our team.

In addition to project work, I designed and implemented a generic housekeeping solution on the BVP server, which automated cleanup tasks and improved overall efficiency.

I proactively resolved late alerting issues for multiple critical applications including BONY, HVPUE, HVPUS, FISERV, and LoaniqUS, ensuring timely monitoring and reducing incident risks.

I also provided SIT, OAT, and RPOD support for various projects, maintaining operational stability and ensuring adherence to timelines.

Alongside delivery work, I completed several technical certifications and learning programs, further enhancing my knowledge and productivity.

Overall, my contributions strengthened platform reliability, improved automation, and supported timely, high-quality releases across multiple applications.


Box 2: Precision in our operations, risk management and controls

I maintained a strong focus on operational precision, control, and governance throughout development and deployment cycles.

All changes were implemented following Barclays’ risk and control frameworks, with thorough peer reviews, SIT validation, and production readiness checks.

The generic housekeeping automation and late alerting fixes significantly reduced manual intervention, improved job monitoring, and minimized production risks.

During SIT, OAT, and RPOD, I ensured proper testing and verification of job dependencies, control points, and data consistency.

I proactively communicated potential risks, collaborated with peers and leads to mitigate issues, and ensured that all releases met Barclays’ quality and compliance standards.
